## Instructions

- Play the track and listen **very** carefully! You only get to do this once per attempt
- Play each fruit (tone) and reorder the fruit such that they recreate the song
- At anytime click Play Fruit to listen to the fruit. (As many times as you want)
- Click submit to see if your fruit matches the song! (Both will be played at the same time)

  If your wrong you move on to your next attempt and can listen to the track again! Fruit in the correct position will be highlighted in green so you don't loss progress!

  Tip: fruit represent a tone, the duration of that tone will differ
